### **LoggingSystemController (src/logging-system/logging-system.controller.ts)**
- Issue: Returning an observable directly from a controller route might not behave as expected in an HTTP context. You'll want to handle the observable properly.
- Suggestion: Use RxJS operators like firstValueFrom or toArray to return the accumulated logs as an array.

### LoggingSystemModule (src/logging-system/logging-system.module.ts)
- Issue: The LoggingInterceptor is registered as a provider but isn't used in this module. If i want it applied globally, i'll need to set it up as a global interceptor in AppModule.
- Suggestion: If it's meant to be global, consider moving it to AppModule as a global interceptor.

### LoggingSystemService (src/logging-system/logging-system.service.ts)
- Typo: The variable logSubjet should be corrected to logSubject.
- Suggestion: Consider storing logs in an array if you need to persist them or send them somewhere, as observables only emit values to current subscribers.

### LoggingInterceptor (src/logging-system/logging.interceptor.ts)
- Suggestion: This interceptor looks good. Make sure it's registered in the AppModule or applied to the necessary controllers.

### AppModule (src/app.module.ts)
- Issue: The LoggingSystemService is registered twice, once in LoggingSystemModule and once in AppModule.
- Suggestion: You only need to register it in one place, ideally in LoggingSystemModule.

## AppController (src/app.controller.ts)
- Suggestion: This setup looks good for applying the interceptor to this controller.
- Final Thoughts: Handling Observables: Make sure to handle the observable returned by log$ properly in your controller so that it can be returned as an HTTP response.
- Global vs. Scoped Interceptors: Decide whether your LoggingInterceptor should be applied globally or only to specific controllers and adjust your setup accordingly.

With these adjustments, my logging system should work smoothly !
